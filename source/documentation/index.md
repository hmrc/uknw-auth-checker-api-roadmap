## What we're working on now

However, some of the existing features of the API might be enhanced, so you should review the NOP [API changelog](https://github.com/hmrc/uknw-auth-checker-api/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md) (GitHub) and the [Document changelog](/guides/uknw-auth-checker-api-service-guide/#changelogs) regularly.

## Updates
- The NOP waiver checker API v1.0 went live on 30th September 2024.

## What we're working on now
The NOP Waiver Checker API v1.0 is preparing for Alpha Assessment. Some of the existing features of the API might be enhanced, so you should review the NOP changelog on GitHub regularly.

## Updates
- NOP Waiver Checker API v1.0 will not be ready for use in production until the NOP Waiver Checker API service goes live.

**Note** It's important to ensure that your customers are equipped to use the new API and have the proper registration details, such as Government Gateway credentials, and that you've prepared them to make transit declarations.
